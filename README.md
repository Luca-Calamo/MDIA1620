 **3 aha moments**
1. figuring out cd and dir. I was quite confused at first but after figuring it out it was satisfying
2. using ol and then li in side of the ol/ learning how to make a list in markdown
3.  using **bolds** and *italics* 
**2 things that are unclear**
1. how to make something bold and italicize
2. when to use html vs markdown
**1 word for how your feeling**

**Learning from 3-2-1**  
I learned how to ***bold and italic***  
I also realized if I use any html code while using markdown it will get confused and stop using markdown ex. my link to the picture will stay a link, double space wont be a line break, and bold and italics wont appear unless in html.
Add something

***3 aha moments***

1. Getting git commit to not give me the aunthentication error

2. learning what primitives are

3. learning the git commands 

***2 things that are unclear***

1. I was having issues with using the let commands without typing let later on in my code

2. I found the git commands a bit confusing

***1 word to describe how I feel***

1. Nervous 

Lesson 6

***3 things I found confusing***

1. I'm having trouble fully understanding the git system, hence me loosing my lesson 5

2. I still have a tough time reading the error message so when my code dosen't work I'm not always sure why

3. I dont understand what ${} means. I can understand what it does but idk why its doing that or even what its called. I think i was trying to fix something during the explanation. ill have to google it later.

***3 things I feel I have a solid grasp on***

1. Im pretty comfortable with remembering the code from the previous classes ex. let, else, else if, if, ect.

2. I feel good about the whole procces of git status, git add, git commit, git push now.

3. I know its not exactly the same but I found arrays kinda easy to understand because they remind me of css a bit.

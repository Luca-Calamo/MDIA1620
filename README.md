1 test.  
 **3 aha moments**
1. figuring out cd and dir. I was quite confused at first but after figuring it out it was satisfying
2. using ol and then li in side of the ol/ learning how to make a list in markdown
3.  using **bolds** and *italics* 
**2 things that are unclear**
1. how to make something bold and italicize
2. when to use html vs markdown

**1 word for how your feeling**
- anxious (exited and nervious not just anxious lol)

**Learning from 3-2-1**  
I learned how to ***bold and italic***  
I also realized if I use any html code while using markdown it will get confused and stop using markdown ex. my link to the picture will stay a link, double space wont be a line break, and bold and italics wont appear unless in html.

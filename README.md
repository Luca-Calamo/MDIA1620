1 test. <br>
 **3 aha moments**
1. figuring out cd and dir. I was quite confused at first but after figuring it out it was satisfying
2. using ol and then li in side of the ol/ learning how to make a list in markdown
3.  using **bolds** and *italics* 
**2 things that are unclear**
1. how to make something bold and italicize ***figured it out :)***
2. when to use html vs markdown

**1 word for how your feeling**
- anxious (exited and nervious not just anxious lol)
